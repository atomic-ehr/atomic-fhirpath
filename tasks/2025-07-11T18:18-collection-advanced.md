# Implement Advanced Collection Operations [pending]

## Overview
Implement advanced collection manipulation operations including sliding windows, partitioning, and complex transformations.

## Tasks
- [ ] Move pending-tests/32-collection-advanced.test.ts to test directory
- [ ] Verify test compliance with FHIRPath specification (./refs/FHIRPath/)
- [ ] Fix test if not compliant with spec
- [ ] Run tests to identify failures
- [ ] Implement advanced collection operations in the codebase

## Requirements from Tests
1. **Sliding window operations**:
   - Process elements in overlapping groups
   - Configurable window size
   - Step/stride support
   - Edge handling options

2. **Partitioning**:
   - Split collections by criteria
   - Chunking by size
   - Preserve element order
   - No element loss

3. **Flattening variants**:
   - Deep flattening
   - Level-specific flattening
   - Preserve structure option

4. **Accumulation patterns**:
   - Running totals
   - Progressive calculations
   - State carrying operations

5. **Collection predicates**:
   - Complex matching logic
   - Multiple condition testing
   - Efficient evaluation

6. **Transform chains**:
   - Multiple operations
   - Lazy evaluation
   - Memory efficiency

## Implementation Notes
- Consider streaming approach
- Memory efficiency crucial
- Lazy evaluation where possible
- Clear semantics for edge cases

## Success Criteria
- All tests in 32-collection-advanced.test.ts pass
- Memory efficient
- Good performance
- Intuitive API
- Well documented
