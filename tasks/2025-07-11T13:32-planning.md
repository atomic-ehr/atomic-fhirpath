# Planning next steps [completed]

We need to plan next steps for FHIRPath project.

* [x] refresh your knowledge from `./docs`
* [x] read current implementation and update it in `./docs/architecture.md`
* [x] reorganize and cleanup `./docs` folder to be structured and uniform (you will use it later as memory bank)
* [x] if we have multiple components create file per component in `./docs/components/`
* [x] read specification in `./refs/FHIRPath/`
* [x] identify what features we are missing (GAP)
* [x] udpate `./docs/roadmap.md` with top 3 important features to implement
* [x] pick the first priority feature and generate draft task for it in `./tasks/<timestamp>-<feature-name>.md`

## Progress Report

### Completed Tasks

1. **Refreshed knowledge from ./docs** ✅
   - Read overview.md - comprehensive project overview
   - Read FHIRPATH-SUPPORT.md - feature support status
   - Read compiler.md - detailed compiler documentation
   - Read parser.md and other documentation files

2. **Created architecture.md** ✅
   - Documented complete project structure
   - Identified all core components
   - Described key interfaces and APIs
   - Listed implementation status
   - Outlined testing strategy and extension points

### Key Findings

The project has a well-structured implementation with:
- Complete parser with caching and error reporting
- Comprehensive type system with inference
- Semantic validation capabilities
- Both basic and typed compiler implementations
- Extensive test coverage

Main gaps identified so far:
- ModelProvider is interface-only (no concrete implementation)
- Some built-in functions not fully implemented
- Missing quantity types with units
- No external constants support
- Limited date/time arithmetic

3. **Reorganized docs folder** ✅
   - Created `docs/components/` directory with component-specific documentation
   - Created docs for: parser, type-system, compiler, type-inference, semantic-validator, function-registry, evaluator
   - Created `docs/README.md` as documentation index
   - Structure is now uniform and organized for use as memory bank

4. **Read FHIRPath specification** ✅
   - Reviewed main specification document
   - Understood navigation model and collections
   - Reviewed function categories and requirements
   - Identified STU (trial use) features

5. **GAP Analysis** ✅
   - Created `docs/gap-analysis.md` with comprehensive feature status
   - Categorized features as: Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented
   - Identified priority gaps based on impact

6. **Created Roadmap** ✅
   - Created `docs/roadmap.md` with top 3 priority features:
     1. ModelProvider Implementation for FHIR Resources (CRITICAL)
     2. Special Variables ($this, $index, $total) (HIGH)
     3. Quantity Type with Units (HIGH)
   - Included implementation strategy and timelines

7. **Generated First Task** ✅
   - Created `tasks/2025-07-11T15:30-model-provider.md`
   - Detailed task for implementing ModelProvider for FHIR R4
   - Includes requirements, design, testing criteria, and effort estimates

## Summary

All planning tasks have been completed successfully. The project now has:
- Comprehensive documentation structure
- Clear understanding of current state and gaps
- Prioritized roadmap for implementation
- First detailed task ready to begin

Next step: Begin implementation of ModelProvider for FHIR R4 resources.
