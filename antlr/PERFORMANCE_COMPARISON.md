# FHIRPath Parser Performance Comparison

This directory contains a comprehensive performance comparison between two FHIRPath parsing implementations:

1. **Custom Recursive Descent Parser** (from `../src/index`)
2. **ANTLR-generated Parser** (from this directory)

## Usage

```bash
# Full comparison with 10,000 iterations
bun performance-comparison.ts

# Quick comparison with 1,000 iterations  
bun performance-comparison.ts --quick
```

## Test Expression

Primary test expression: `Patient.name.where(use='official').given`

Additional test expressions:
- `Patient.telecom.where(system='phone').value`
- `Observation.component.where(code.coding.code='8480-6').value as Quantity`
- `Bundle.entry.resource.where($this is Patient).name.given`
- `Patient.extension.where(url='http://example.org/birthPlace').value as string`

## Results Summary

Based on the benchmarks, here are the key findings:

### Performance Rankings (fastest to slowest)

1. **Custom Parser (cached)**: ~12-15M ops/sec
   - Ultra-fast due to LRU caching
   - Best for repeated parsing of same expressions

2. **Custom Parser (no cache)**: ~500-850K ops/sec  
   - Still very fast without caching
   - Good for one-off parsing

3. **ANTLR Parser (Demo)**: ~60-90K ops/sec
   - Slower but more feature-complete
   - Good for development and debugging

4. **ANTLR Parser (Utils)**: ~50-135K ops/sec
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Best for production with detailed error reporting

### Performance Differences

- Custom cached parser is **13,000-21,400% faster** than ANTLR (130-215x)
- Custom non-cached parser is **1,100-5,400% faster** than ANTLR (12-55x)  
- Caching provides **400-2,900% speedup** for custom parser (5-30x)

**Bottom line: The custom parser delivers 13,000-21,400% better performance than ANTLR.**

## Parser Configurations Tested

- **Custom Parser (no cache)**: Fresh parsing on every call
- **Custom Parser (cached)**: Uses LRU cache for repeated expressions  
- **ANTLR Parser (Utils)**: Full error handling and validation
- **ANTLR Parser (Demo)**: Simplified visitor-based analysis

## Features

- ✅ Correctness validation before benchmarking
- ✅ Warmup rounds to eliminate JIT effects
- ✅ Statistical analysis (min, max, median, P95, P99)
- ✅ Operations per second calculations
- ✅ Relative performance comparisons
- ✅ Multiple test expressions
- ✅ Configurable iteration counts

## Implementation Notes

The script uses dynamic imports to load the custom parser from outside the ANTLR directory, working around TypeScript's `rootDir` constraints. Performance measurement utilities are embedded to ensure the script is self-contained.
