# User-Defined Functions Support Summary

## What was done

The FHIRPath parser already supports user-defined functions without any code changes needed! The parser's design naturally accommodates custom functions through its identifier parsing logic.

## How it works

1. **Tokenizer**: Recognizes any valid identifier (letters, digits, underscores)
2. **Parser**: When an identifier is followed by `(`, it's parsed as a function call
3. **No distinction**: Parser doesn't differentiate between built-in and custom functions
4. **Semantic phase**: Function validation is deferred to the evaluation/semantic analysis phase

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suites to verify user-defined function support:

### `test/user-defined-functions.test.ts`
- Simple function calls: `Patient.myCustomFunction()`
- Functions with arguments: `Patient.formatName(given, family)`
- Various naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, with numbers)
- Global functions: `myGlobalFunction(Patient, Observation)`
- Chained functions: `Patient.transform1().transform2()`
- Mixed with built-in functions
- Functions with all argument types (literals, dates, variables, expressions)

### `test/function-edge-cases.test.ts`
- Functions that start/contain keywords: `whereCustom()`, `hasWhereClause()`
- Disambiguation between properties and functions
- Deeply nested function calls
- Functions in all expression positions (indexers, operators, etc.)

## Examples

```fhirpath
// Custom functions work everywhere
Patient.name.customFormat()
Patient.calculateAge(@2023-01-01, "years")
Patient.name[customPredicate()]
customGlobal(Patient, Observation)

// Mix with built-in functions
Patient.name
  .where(use = 'official')    // built-in
  .customTransform()          // user-defined
  .first()                    // built-in
```

## Documentation

Created `docs/user-defined-functions.md` with:
- Detailed explanation of how it works
- Usage examples
- Implementation considerations for semantic analysis
- Best practices for naming and documentation

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero parser changes needed** - The design already supports it
2. **Maximum flexibility** - Any valid identifier can be a function
3. **Clean separation** - Parsing vs semantic analysis concerns
4. **Uniform AST** - Same structure for all function calls
5. **Future-proof** - New functions can be added without parser updates

## Performance Impact

None - The parser already treats all identifiers uniformly, so there's no additional overhead for supporting user-defined functions.
